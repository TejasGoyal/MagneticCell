# MagneticCell
Magnetic Cell MatLab Graph 
I worked on this project during winter 2018.
The team of three - College Professor, Research Student and me - worked on this project.
I was assigned the task to develop a code for optimized magnetic field in the setup.

The setup shall be used for biomedical application in drug delivery.

MatLab code was developed and graph were made for visual understanding of the governing effects of parameters effecting the field.
Please check my github repository MagneticCell for the graphs and model code.
